            <h2>Special Containment Procedures</h2>
            <p>SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique functions require special
                measures be taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level
                4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area.</p>

        <div class="caseDescription">
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced
                key used in the 1920s. The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security
                facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A),
                be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="reference">
            <h2>Additional Notes:</h2>
            <p>SCP-005 may be used as a replacement for lost security passes, but only under the supervision of at least
                one (1) Level 4 personnel. SCP-005 may not be used for vending machine repairs, opening lockers, or for
                any personnel's spare home key. Removal of the object from the compound will result in immediate
                termination.</p>

            <h2>Appendix A:</h2>
            <p>While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further
                experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least
                somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability. In approximately 50% of cases where a volunteer was
                not able to identify a locking device as such, SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device.
                Due to these results, SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and further tests are being
                run to determine its cognitive abilities. However, there are no results that show any traits that
                prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device, only that the aforementioned
                device has been heavily concealed and disguised.</p>
